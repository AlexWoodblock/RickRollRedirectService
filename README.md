## Rick Roll Redirect Service

Simple Kotlin + Ktor service that redirects you to a Rick Roll, and tracks how many people and how long ago were Rick Rolled.

This is ready to be deployed on free tier-Heroku + free-tier PostgreSQL there.

## Alternative
Or just go to https://qr.io/ and use their service, it's a better alternative :D
